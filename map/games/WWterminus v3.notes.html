The Terminus Version of WW2v4 (A&A 1942). <br>
		        	Classic transports, units 17-25% cheaper, each faction gets 1 exclusive unit, battles block production for 1 turn. (You immediately produce if undefended.) <br>
					London, Berlin, Moscow, and Tokyo are worth 2 VC points. Honolulu is a VC. <br>
